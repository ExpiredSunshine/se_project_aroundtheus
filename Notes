    this._deleteCardModal = document.querySelector("#delete-card-modal");

    It's not needed because _handleTrashClick is not needed in line 67

    this._element.remove();
    this._element = null;
  _handleTrashClick() {




    Please, delete it from Card.js because any modal should be created in index.js using a class extended from Popup. There are open and _handleEscClose methods for that

    _handleTrashClick is not needed here because you reassign it in the constructor in line 15

        You need to close modals only in then blocks after a successful response from the server so that when there is an error, it would be opened (the inputs will not be cleared and the user could send the data again to the server), and if you change the button text, you could see the change as well. Please, correct it everywhere in the code

        You need to reset the form only in a then block in order not to do that immediately after submit because when there is an error, the modal will still be opened, and the user can try to send the data again to the server without having to type the data into the inputs once more.

          Now only class Card knows every card selector, so you need to encapsulate the likes logics inside its methods and call them in index.js. It’s a violation of Single responsibility principle

          You can't search the like button here. It's been found inside Card, so you need to do it inside Card

       You should make a special function createCard for creating a card not to copy-paste the code when you need to add a new card with append.
